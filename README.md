Project Overview
In this project, we utilize NLP techniques to analyze hotel reviews and provide actionable advice to hotels and 
companies. By leveraging the power of machine learning and text analysis, we aim to extract key insights from 
customer feedback and identify patterns and trends that can help improve customer satisfaction and service quality.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of hotel reviews, including customer feedback, ratings, and other relevant 
attributes. The dataset is included in this repository labeled as "hotel_reviews.csv

Dependencies
To run this project locally, the following dependencies are required:
Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt 

Usage
Follow these steps to use this project:
1. Ensure that you have installed all the necessary dependencies.
2. Obtain the dataset and place it in the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook Hotel_Reviews.ipynb . Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to 
execute the code and generate insights.

Data Preprocessing
The Hotel_Reviews.ipynb notebook contains detailed explanations and code for the following data 
preprocessing steps:
1. Loading and understanding the dataset.
2. Handling missing values and data cleaning.
3. Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data.
4. Feature engineering, if necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis
The Hotel_Reviews.ipynb notebook includes exploratory data analysis, where I visualized and analyze the 
distribution of ratings, sentiment analysis, word frequencies, and other relevant aspects of the dataset. This helps in 
understanding customer sentiments and preferences.

Text Processing
The notebook covers the text processing steps, including:
1. Tokenization: Splitting reviews into individual words or tokens.
2. Stop word removal: Filtering out commonly occurring words that carry little meaning.
3. Lemmatization or stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form.
4. Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word 
embeddings.

Model Development
The notebook presents the model development process, including:
1. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Applying machine learning algorithms such as classification or clustering.
3. Training and fine-tuning the models.
4. Evaluating the models using appropriate metrics.

Evaluation
I evaluated the performance of the developed models based on relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, 
F1-score, and others. This evaluation helps in determining the effectiveness of the models in analyzing hotel reviews
and providing valuable insights.

Results
The results obtained from the analysis of hotel reviews are summarized in the notebook. Which includes visualizations, sentiment analysis, key findings, and actionable advice that hotels and
companies can consider for improving their services.
